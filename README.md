A simple calculator built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
This project was created to practice front-end development fundamentals and to showcase a small but complete web app.

## ✨ Features
- Basic arithmetic operations (+, −, ×, ÷)
- Additional utilities:
  - Clear (AC)
  - Delete (DEL)
  - Percent (%)
  - Toggle sign (+/−)
- Supports decimal numbers
- Keyboard support (use numbers, operators, Backspace, Enter, etc.)
- Handles edge cases (e.g., divide by zero shows "Error")
- Responsive layout with a modern UI
